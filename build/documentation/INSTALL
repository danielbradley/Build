		Build Version 0.8.0 (2008) Install Instructions
		Copyright (c) 2008, Daniel Robert Bradley

TO BUILD AND INSTALL
	We now emulate (badly) the GNU build system - configure, make, make install
	This will be improved for the 1.0 release.

	For posix systems type:

		cd build-0.8.0/Source
		./configure [--prefix=PATH]
		make
		make install

	For win32 type:

		cd build-0.8.0\Source
		set PREFIX=PATH
		configure
		make
		make install

ENJOY
	May you never need to use make again!
