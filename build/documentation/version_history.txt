06 Feb 2008:	build-0.8.0rc0

	Just general tidying up and fixing of bugs.
	Support for non-C/C++ is still unstable.
	Support for paths with spaces is doubtful.

13 Jan 2006:	build-0.7.0

	Have added basic support for building java projects and added
	islabs_jdk_sun provider.
	To build java put source hierarchy under package/source/java,
	and put manifest file in package/source/java/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF

06 Jul 2005:	build-0.6.0

	Now adds -L<DIR> for specified system libraries, eg. -L/usr/X11R6/lib
	for link files to /usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.so.
	Fixed bug where non-existant lib directory caused build failure.
	Fixed incorrect --version problem.

09 Mar 2005:	build-0.5.17

	islabs_win32_gnu provider has been implemented. It seems to
	work reasonably but doesn't yet compile the OpenOCL libraries.
	There are still a number of memory leaks, these will be removed
	during 0.6. Test Packages are now checked to see if they have been
	already run.

08 Mar 2005:	build-0.5.16

	Package compile scripts updated for linux and win32.
	islabs_win32_gnu (MinGW) provider still needs to be reimplemented.

08 Mar 2005:	build-0.5.15

	Removed legacy code path (in attic) and commented out old
	provider functions. islabs_win32_gnu provider still needs to
	be reimplemented. Package compile scripts need to be modified
	to reflect the changes. 

07 Mar 2005:	build-0.5.14

	Removed Link.h and Link.c from libislabs_build.

07 Mar 2005:	build-0.5.13

	Implicit --build-tests argument assumed if run from within
	a test directory. There is currently a small amount of
	unallocated memory when the program terminates.

04 Mar 2005:	build-0.5.12

	Now stops if an error is encountered compiling a package/file.
	Incremental compilation seems to be working correctly. Will be
	removing all the legacy stuff very soon in anticipation of
	version 0.6.0.

14 Feb 2005:	build-0.5.11

	Have implemented incremental compilation. Each source file (.c,.cpp)
	is compare to its corresponding object file. If it has been modified
	the file is recompiled. To override use --force argument.

	Note that changes to headers will not yet be recognized.

05 Nov 2004:	build-0.5.10

	Have implemented --build-tests-only and --run-tests-only, and made
	--monolithic default. Updated openocl version dependency links in
	lib.

03 Nov 2004:	build-0.5.9

	Have disabled distributable code-path completely.

03 Nov 2004:	build-0.5.8

	Have implemented --run-tests.

01 Nov 2004:	build-0.5.7

	Have implemented TestPackage, Suite and TestSuite types. Only
	thing that isn't implemented on the buildable code path so far
	is --run-tests.

28 Oct 2004:	build-0.5.6

	Moved partially over to the Buildable codepath.
