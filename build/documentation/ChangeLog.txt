Release information for Build
Last update: 10 September 2011

0.9.2rc1

Layout of source has been modified: library dependencies are now
stored in the "dep" directory instead of "lib", "lib" is now
solely used for library build products. The source directory has
been renamed from "source/src" to "source/<language>" -- for
example: "source/c", "source/cplusplus", "source/java", and
"source/csharp".

Some options, such as building to external target, have been
removed as these options need a rethink after separating the lib
and dep directories. This functionality will be readded before
release of v1.0.0.

0.8.0

Lots has changed. Lots has stayed the same. Mainly fixed bugs.

0.5.1

This is the first major revision of the 0.4 code base. Support for
loadable "toolset" modules is being added. Objects that need to be
shared between the build executable and loaded library modules are
being moved to a library. This is mainly necessary as under Windows
I can't find a way to have a DLL resolve to symbols defined in the
parent executable.

In short, a toolset module handles the usage of the compiler and
linker from a particular vendor on a particular platform. The
build executable tells the toolset that something should be compiled
and the toolset determines how it should be compiled.

0.3.4.1

Added usage statement and added several new command line options.
Importantly added -r (recursive) option which causes build to
follow dependency package links. Changed --all to --deep; builds deeply
within the target directory. Added -n (no means no). Added --help which
prints the command summary. Added --log which creates build.log file of
commands that were/would be, executed. Added --copy-libs option to copy
library dependencies to bin directory.

0.3.4

Due to excessive command line lengths cause by multiple inclusions, the
sub-functions of initializeFlags now only include those dependency
directories that contain unique directories.

Most work is now done in determineLibs/determineLibsFlags; each time a
new library is encountered it is added to the -l flags and the directory
it is within is added to the -L and -Wl,-R$ORIGIN flags.

0.3.3.1

Directory_open(): Fixed bug that had directory's file descriptors not being closed 

0.3.3

build.c's initialize flags function now uses the Directory class's
Directory_search method to retrieve a list dependency lib directories. This
is now used to determine "-L" lib dirs, "-l" linkage flags and "-Wl,-rpath"
$ORIGIN style runtime flags.

The program now recursively searches the entire dependency hierarchy and attempts
to link everything it encounters. While this isn't optimally elegant, it works.
This was caused by the disappearence of existing linkage functionality. Need to
investigate this in the future.

0.3.2

Build is now pretty stable on linux-gnu and win32 platforms. The only problem
on Win32 seems to be long path lengths: canonicalization of link target paths
has been used to reduce the length of dependency paths, however compiler output
file paths are still causing problems for deeply nested source packages. Note that
this isn't really a problem with build, but a limitation on maximum path length
under windows.

Cygwin PSA work has been put on hold while the rest of the functionality to be
added for 0.3 is added.

0.3.1

A lot has been done for this revision as support for cygwin and win32 is
being heavily worked upon. In particular IO and Process PSA files have been
added. Linux-gnu and cygwin ports seem stable, not sure about win32.

0.3

Default behaviour now is to only build local source directory. Recursive
builds can be enabled using the --all or --depth <n> parameters. Fixed
some bugs.

0.2

Did a major overhaul of the proof-of-concept. Got rid of global variables
and properly deliniated between Global flags and flags for a specific
compilation context.

0.1

Proof of concept implementation of the general "build" idea. Honestly, its 
pretty ugly with no real effort to deallocate memmory or do recursion that
well. I'm pretty surprised that I was actually able to use it to 
perform builds of version 0.2.
